## PROJECT MyPokédex

:white_check_mark: Consumes the PokéAPI API for creating pokémon cards with pokémons OR their indexes when typed in the input.

:white_check_mark: Higher Order Functions were used to search for the keys needed to
create the cards, as well as ES6 features.

:white_check_mark: The site allows cards to be stored in LocalStorage, making it possible to keep a list of Pokemon saves until it is deleted.

:white_check_mark: In the styling, Flexbox and the Bootstrap framework were used.
